<!-- 
Name: Stefan Suarez
Assignment: Lab5
Final Draft: 10/15/2014
Description: Play around with the D3 example in the book shown last class period.
Note: I have added comments next to the stuff I changed in histogram.html and histogram.js.
All values in histogram-hours.json have been altered as well.
Extra Note: Bars are green in memory of my bird that died this week. Just wish I could have done
a gradient green to yellow, and also that I could have done more to save him. :(

<p><em>Green in memory of my parakeet, Kiwi, who died tonight on 10/15/2014, a little over one hour before class.
    Fairwell, buddy. I'm sorry I couldn't do more to help you. :(</em></p>
