Collection of Labs for Semester Fall 2014

This collection of folders represents the labs I worked on during my web programming course in Fall 2014. Much
of the content is my own work with some exceptions.

Lab 5 was an original program demonstrated for the purposes of the class that we were told to alter. My alterations 
are done in histogram.json and histogram.js for that particular lab. 

The instances of jQuery and Bootstrap littered throughout this repository obviously do not belong to me nor did I create
them. They are, however, necessary for the programs to work.

Sources of information that helped me write these programs are listed below in no particular order:

www.w3schools.com
Various github repositories
MANY stackoverflow.com threads(biggest help during the whole semester)
jQuery documentation
D3js.org
Data Visualization with D3.js By Swizec Teller(Lab 5's original was taken from this book's Chapter 1)
