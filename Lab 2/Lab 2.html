<h2 style="color:darkgreen">"JavaScript: The Good Parts" Notes.</h2>
<p style="color:darkgreen">Since the instructions were unclear this time about what it meant to make the notes show up as code,
I took it at face value to mean I should input my notes into a code tag and format it in that way, rather than make
a javascript program that would alter a page to show the script used to display notes - especially since I could not get a JavaScript program to store such a long string in an elegant manner.
I did manage to utilize at least a little JavaScript to alter the background and a little CSS to alter the text colors.</p>

	<pre><code id="Notes1" style="color:darkblue">
<h3><em>I. Mediocre Parts</em></h3>
<strong>	A. "Loose typing"</strong>: any variable or parameter can contain any type of value
			1. Can be scary, but strict typing, where you have to specify the type of value a variable will hold, doesn't absolve you of the need to test.
				You'll have to test either way.
			2. Reason why this is mediocre is because it does have the benefit of making it so that you don't have to mess with the type system.
				"Liberating," as Crockford called it.


<h3><em>II. Horrendously Bad Parts</em></h3>
<strong>	A. Global variables</strong>
			1. Language does not have a "linker" so all variables get tossed together where they can collide. This produces bad reliability
				and security issues. Allows Cross-side script attacks.
<strong>	B. Uses + to add and concatenate(add on words to each other)</strong>
			1. Came from Java, in which it wasn't as much of a problem because of the strongly typed language. Since Javascript is loosely typed, though, 
				you don't have that fall-back. 
<strong>	C. Automatically inserts semicolons.</strong>
			1. To paraphrase, Crockford basically said that, when the compiler gets jumbled, it goes back, searches for a line feed and inserts a semicolon. 
				This can produce some interesting results.
<strong>	D. Typeof Command</strong>
			1. Can be useful sometimes, but it has two quirks.
				a. Array = object : Not helpful
				b. Null = object : WRONG!
<strong>	E. With and Eval statements</strong>
			1. Avoid them. They slow down the program.
			2. Supposedly, a newer version of JavaScript with a strict tag would completely remove the ability to use With statements and highly
				limit the ability to use Eval statements. 
<strong>	F. Phony Arrays</strong>
			1. Arrays don't have dimensions and are not meant to be quick in javascript. Simplifies the language, but takes away a piece of utility.
<strong>	G. = = operator</strong>(spaced in order to show that it's actually two equal signs)
			1. It does type coercion and will compare strings to numbers while possibly returning a true boolean.
			2. Example:
			
			var x = 1= ="1"
			return x
			//will return true which is not correct since one is an integer and the other is a string.
<strong>	H. For..in statements</strong>
			1. Design decision on this statement was not thoroughly explained to the language users, and so there is a lot of confusion on how to use it.
<strong>	I. Blockless statements: No curly brackets means potentially broken code</strong>
			Example of broken code:

			If(foo)
				bar();
	
<strong>	J. Expression statements</strong>
			1. You can create a statement with just a variable name and it won't do anything.
<strong>	K. Floating Point arithmetic</strong>
			1. Floating point is the only number type in the language, but it's not always accurate. That's a problem when processing financial information.
<strong>	L. ++(increment) and -- (decrement)</strong>
			1. These are present, but they are still notorious for buffer overruns and security hazards


<em><h3>III. Good parts that behave badly together</h3></em>
<strong>	A. Objects can inherit from other objects</strong>
<strong>	B. Functions can be members of objects</strong>
<strong>	C. For..in statement that mixes inherited functions with the desired data members</strong></p>


<h3><em>IV. Marvelously Good Parts</h3></em>
<strong>	A.Lambda</strong>
			1. Douglas Crockford praises it during his lecture, but doesn't really tell me what it is.
<strong>	B. Dynamic Objects</strong>
			1. Take any object and at any time add or remove a property from it.
			2. No "Classes" to worry about.
<strong>	C. Object literals</strong>
<strong>	D. Closure</strong>
			1. To the best of my understanding, closure is the use of {} in this language in order to create function objects that can reference private variables and 
				parameters in themselves without the need for using global variables.
<strong>	E. Tools such as JSLint are available to help in dealing with bad code habits</strong>
<strong>	F. JavaScript applications can reach a potential audience of billions</strong>
<strong>	G. If you avoid the bad parts JavaScript works really well.</strong>
<strong>	H. It is possible to write good programs with JavaScript</strong>


<h3><em>V. Things to watch out for:</em></h3>
<strong>	Style is not subjective in this language.</strong>

	Return
	{
		ok: false
	};

	will give you a silent error. You must place the upper bracket just after the word "return" in the same line. If not, the compiler will generate
	the following:

	Return;
	{
		ok: false;
	}

	Which is nothing but empty and expression statements due to semi-colon insertion.
