<h1>Fooling with text.</h1>
<p>This program is my attempt at messing with user input for color and text as
a way to combine the example program for this lab with some of the initial examples on w3schools.
Just follow the instructions for the fields and try to input something silly.</p>

<div align="left">
	<form>
	<p>Your Name: <input type="text" id="name1"></p>
	<p>An Activity or Hobby: <input type="text" id="hobby1"></p>
	<p>A City Name: <input type="text" id="place1"></p>
	<p>Now click on the color button you wish your answer to come out in.</p>
	
	<input type="button" value="Dark Green" onclick="generatetext1();">
	<input type="button" value="Indigo" onclick="generatetext2();">
	<input type="button" value="Maroon" onclick="generatetext3();">
	<!--
	Note to self: try and find a different website to compliment W3Schools because some of the information seems to be outdated and lacking.
	I was originally going to use a setTimeout function but researching other websites revealed it was more complicated than W3Schools led
	me to believe.
